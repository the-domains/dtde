On speaking this weekend in Elora..
This Sunday, March 1st, I've been asked to speak in Elora, where I once lived, as part of a series of talks embracing five art forms.
I've decided to use my 7 years of writing A Handbook for Ecstatic Survival as the content of my talk, describing how I hope to structure the book and what it might contain - Biography; Dance as an art form; Teaching; Creating - threaded through with memories and confessions.
I will be revealing myself as a spy, a thief and a fake, as every creative artist must, to some degree, dare to be.
Certainly, I have witnessed greatness, and would like to share the gifts I've received. 
I will probably remain fully clothed...
