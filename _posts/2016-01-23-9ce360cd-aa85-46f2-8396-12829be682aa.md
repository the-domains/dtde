Every year, on _International Women's Day_, my company presents a program honouring the creative, crusading women who, through dance, transformed the public image of women forever. 

Isadora Duncan, Mary Wigman, and Martha Graham are just a few well-known names ...pioneers in an artistic and social revolution... but there are many, many more. 

Today we have such extraordinary figures close at hand. Margie Gillis and Peggy Baker to name just two. 

Dancetheatre David Earle is a consciously Neo Expressionist dance company. We dance to communicate, with highly evolved instruments, to great music.  

We believe in the gift of character in movement.  Both youth and maturity have their place in any genuine theatre of humanity.
